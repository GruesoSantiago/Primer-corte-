# Pythagorean Theorem

With a Right Triangles, the sum of the squares of the lengths of each side adjacent to the right angle (known as catheti) is the same as the square of the length of hypotenuse.

## Problem Definition

Write a Python program that calculates the hypotenuse of a right triangle given the two catheti.

### Input

    3
    4

### Output

    5

## Use and test

    cd 01_Pythagoras
    python3 hypotenuse.py
    cd tests
    python3 hypotenuse_test.py

## Background Information
