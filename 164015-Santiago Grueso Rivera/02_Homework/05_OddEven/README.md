# Odd and Even

Lists are useful data structures. When they contain integer numbers, we need to separate those numbers in two different lists, one containing Odd numbers and the other one containing Even numbers.

## Problem Definition

Separate odd and even numbers in a list, and return both lists.

### Input

    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

### Output

    ([1, 3, 5, 7, 9], [2, 4, 6, 8])

## Use and test

    cd 05_OddEven
    python3 odd_even.py
    cd tests
    python3 odd_even_test.py
