# Hello, World!

This is a practice problem. It's already solved so you can read the solution an understand the way those problems are structured, and the purpose of every directory and file. You can use this as a guide or template for the next problems.

## Problem Definition

Write a Python program that output the classic "Hello, World!" salute based on its passed argument. If there is no argument, or the argument is an empty string or None, the output will be "Hello, World!". For any other name like "Diego" the output should be "Hello, Diego!".

### Input

    None

### Output

    Hello, World!

## Use and test

    cd 02_Hello
    python3 hello.py
    cd tests
    python3 hello_test.py

## Background Information

"Hello, World!" is the classic very simple program used to teach the basics of a programming language. Read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program).

For a function with a declared parameter to work with no argument passed, you should define a default value for that, as explained [here](http://www.diveintopython.net/power_of_introspection/optional_arguments.html).
