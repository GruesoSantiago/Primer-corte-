# Sequence

This is a practice problem. It's already solved so you can read the solution an understand the way those problems are structured, and the purpose of every directory and file. You can use this as a guide or template for the next problems.

## Problem Definition

Given an integer number, write a Python program that output how many steps until the result is 1, applying these rules:
a. if the number is even, the next will be half the number
b. if the number is odd, the next will be triple the number plus one

Note: Use _helper_ functions such as is_even() and is_odd(), those will be tested too.

### Input

    15

### Output

    17

## Use and test

    cd 05_Sequence
    python3 sequence.py
    cd tests
    python3 sequence_test.py

## Background Information
