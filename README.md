# Recommendations

* Document your program: program name, description, author, date?
* Comment your code: what it does, what parameters it has, how do you test it?
* Write clear, meaningful and relevant comments where they are need it (trust me, you're gonna need them later)
* Indentation maybe be optional in other languages but it's mandatory in Python.
* Use 4 spaces for indentation. Never use TABs in source code files. 
* Write your lines of code no more than 80 characters long.
* Put One blank line between function definitions.
* Function names should start with a Verb and using [camelCase](http://wiki.c2.com/?CamelCase).
* Variable names should start with a Noun and using lowercase, [PascalCase](http://wiki.c2.com/?PascalCase) or with [underscores](http://wiki.c2.com/?CapitalizationRules).
* Constants should be written all uppercase.
* If you found yourself repeting code, there must be something wrong with your design. There should be no redundant code. 
* Always use helper functions (or methods)
* Make sure your code pass all test (add any test you think necessary)
